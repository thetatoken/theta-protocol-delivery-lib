# Theta Mesh Delivery Protocol

The Theta Mesh Delivery Protocol handles bandwidth sharing. Currently it is implemented as a lightweight JavaScript library built on top of WebRTC. It can be integrated into web pages with minimal effort, and enables instant browser-to-browser stream data sharing among viewers. Advanced geolocation and connectivity history based peer grouping algorithms have been designed to maximize peer offload with guaranteed delivery QoS. A high level description of the mesh delivery technology is detailed in our blog post ["Building the Theta Protocol: Part II - Overview of the Hybrid Mesh Streaming Technology"](https://medium.com/theta-network/building-the-theta-protocol-part-ii-ea9d12e221bb).

This repository contains the packaged JavaScript client library along with a few integration examples.

## Demo

To see the mesh delivery protocol in action, please click [here for the Theta Test Channel](https://www.sliver.tv/win/usr880k7j7388ribhvy) on SLIVER.tv. You would need to register an account on SLIVER.tv to see the live demo, which should look similar to the screenshot below.
